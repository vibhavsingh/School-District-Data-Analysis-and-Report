# School District Data Analysis and Report

## The Purpose
The purpose of this Project was to analyze a school district's data. Using pandas and python, analysis of how each school of a particular district was done and insights were drawn from it. 

## Resulting Insights
For this particular district's data resulted in the following insights: 
- As a whole, schools with higher budgets, did not yield better test results. By contrast, schools with higher spending per student actually ($645-675) underperformed compared to schools with smaller budgets (<$585 per student).

- As a whole, smaller and medium sized schools dramatically out-performed large sized schools on passing math performances (89-91% passing vs 67%).

- As a whole, charter schools out-performed the public district schools across all metrics. However, more analysis will be required to glean if the effect is due to school practices or the fact that charter schools tend to serve smaller student populations per school.
